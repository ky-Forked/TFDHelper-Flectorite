# Flectorite

Flectorite is a modification for *The First Descendant*, building upon the original work of DescendantInternal. This version is designed to be a cleaner and more distinct tool.

A key feature of Flectorite is its ability to prevent Black Cipher from launching with the game. This requires bypassing EAC (EasyAntiCheat) beforehand.

## ðŸ›‘ Important Notices

* **Game Settings:** For optimal performance and to avoid crashes, please disable Frame Generation (both NVIDIA and AMD). It is also recommended to set your desired screen resolution *before* injecting the DLL, as changing it mid-game will cause a crash. This tool may not function correctly with 4K or ultra-wide resolutions.
* **Configuration File:** The configuration file, `cfg.ini`, will be created in `...The First Descendant\M1\Binaries\Win64` after the first successful injection. If you experience crashes, try deleting this file.
* **Disclaimer:** Using this tool, especially a public version, carries an inherent risk of a game ban. While it has been tested to minimize this risk, use it at your own discretion.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Bypass EAC

1.  Open Steam, right-click on **The First Descendant**, and select **Manage** > **Browse local files**.
2.  Navigate to the `EasyAntiCheat` folder and open `Settings.json`.
3.  You will find three IDs in this file. Randomly change a few letters and numbers within these IDs. **Do not alter the total length of the IDs.**
4.  Save the `Settings.json` file. This will prevent EAC from properly connecting.

## 2. Building from Source

To build the `Flectorite.dll` from the source code, please follow these steps:

1.  Open the solution in Visual Studio. You can do this by clicking on **Code** and then **Open with Visual Studio**.
2.  Set the build configuration to **Release** and the platform to **x64**.
3.  Build the solution by navigating to **Build > Build Solution**.
4.  Once the build is complete, you can find the **Flectorite.dll** file in the output folder.

### 3. Injection Process

**Note:** It is highly recommended to use **Extreme Injector v3.7.2 or v3.7.3** for the initial setup.

1.  Launch Extreme Injector and select "The First Descendant" process, then close the game.
2.  In Extreme Injector, add the Flectorite DLL.
3.  Configure the injection settings to **Standard Injection** and **Auto-Inject**.
4.  Relaunch *The First Descendant*. The injector should automatically inject the DLL as the game starts and then close itself. You may need to pre-select M1-Win64-Shipping.exe from the processes by browsing your game files to TheFirstDescendant>M1>Binaries>Win64>M1-Win64-Shipping.exe

You may see a "disconnected from server" error on the title screen; this is normal. Simply try to log in again. The menu, accessed with the **INSERT** key, will be available once you are fully in-game.

## ðŸ”§ For Developers (Using the Source)

The included source code should allow you to build the solution without any initial errors.

* **SDK Updates:** To update the SDK, use a tool like Dumper-7 to get a fresh dump from the game and compare class and struct sizes and offsets. Core engine classes rarely change, so focus on the M1 classes.
* **Adding Functionality:** If you wish to add new features that rely on classes or structs not already in the project, you will need to modify the relevant areas. The project has been stripped down to the essentials.

If you have questions or need help, first read through all the instructions given and maybe check the other forum to see if someone had the same issue at some point. Ill try to respond and help but I am very inconsistent with when I am able to sit down and troubleshoot for hours.
If things aren't working for you, double check things on your side before saying something is broke with the DLL, this version in testing before I uploaded it here had issues but we held back on releasing it until everyone that had issues getting it to work no longer did. Otherwise if an update didnt come out recently, the DLL is most likely working fine for most other people.
